# Subfolders

I wonder if this works with subfolders.


Let's hope it does.

I wonder if I can do [relative back up links](Try this.md), that point to a file in a higher up folder? Maybe .... I tried ../Try This.md as a link and it didn't work. Maybe I can fix it in the parsing?

Oh that seems to work... but wouldn't with a double I guess. The lesson is direct rather than relative link if you can.
