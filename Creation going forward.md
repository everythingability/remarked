# Creation Going Forward!

Oh yes I can, when using **MacDown** it has a preference you have to click.

For me, "Creation Going Forward" is one of the most important feature of any *wiki* or *knowledge garden* thing, and it's the ability to define a link, using square brackets or whatever, and then clicking that link and contributing content to that new document.

The alternative is going somewhere else to create a document (with a name) that is empty, then coming back to where you were and adding a link to that thing (which now exits), then following the link to add content. It just kills the flow.

Also links that you make, that don't exist yet can be used as personal placeholders, that sort of say "something should be here later".

I'd better check and see if you can do [external links](https://www.andertons.co.uk/boss-katana-go-personal-guitar-headphone-amplifier). Oh bugger, no, let's fix that. Done I think.
